# Distributed Systems, assignment 1

The focus of this task was to get familiar with sockets and threading by creating a chatroom using either TCP or UDP connections. I chose the former.

To start the chatroom, launch the server.py file with either a button in your IDE, or with a command akin to `python -u "your_path\server.py"`.
YMMV which commands are needed. The above works on VSCode, with the Jupyter/MagicPython extensions.

After launching the server, you can start clients in another command line, with a similar command `python -u "your_path\client.py"`.
For multiple clients, open up another command line and re-enter the above command.

To quit, type `!qq` in a client's message box.

To shut down the server, just close the terminal it is residing in :-D.
